### Project_01: Visual Data Analysis
The goal in this project was to visually analyze the Gapminder Dataset. This dataset includes the data for each country's population and fertiliy rate during last 200 years. Pandas and Matplotlib libraries were used to visualize the data and creating an animated scatterplot

The final created animated graph:

### Project_02: Classification

In this project, I investigated the Titanic Dataset using Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. a comprehensive data analysis and feature engineering was performed and data was preprocessed for machine learning. Moreover, Random Forest and Logistic Regression models were trained. Accuracy scores were between 78% and 81% and a A k-fold Cross Validation scores around 96%.

### Project_03: Regression
The goal for this project was to build and train a regression model on the Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.) data set, in order to predict demand for bicycle rentals at any given hour, based on time and weather. After a detailed EDA and correlation analysis as well as feature engineeering and data preprocessing, linear regression and random forest regressor models were used to predict the number of bikes. a r2 score of 0.98 was achieved for trai data using Random Forest Regressor, while the r2 score for test data was 0.87

### Project_04: Text Classification

In this project, i built a text classification model on song lyrics. The task was to predict the artist from a piece of text. python functions were programmed to do the Web Scraping with the help of BeautifulSoup to download song lyrics from artist's url and save only the corpus lyrics as texts files from every single song lyrics url. For this purpose, first, the HTML file containing the lyrics from the website was downloaded as a text file. then hyperlinks of song pages was extracted and the song lyrics were extracted using BeautifulSoup the text were then vectorized using TfidfVectorizer and a classification model (i.e., logistic regression) was trained to predict the artist from a piece of text

### Project_05: Dashboard - Postgres, SQL, RDS, and AWS


### Project_06: Pipeline - Docker, MongoDB, and ETL


### Project_07: Time Series Analysis
The objective in this project was to create a short-term temperature forecast involving time series. AR and ARIMA models with a Walk Forward approach was used. 

### Project_08: Data Simulator
