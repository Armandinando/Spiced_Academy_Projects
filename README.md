### Project_01: Visual Data Analysis
The goal in this project was to visually analyze the Gapminder Dataset. This dataset includes the data for each country's population and fertiliy rate during last 200 years. Pandas and Matplotlib libraries were used to visualize the data and creating an animated scatterplot

The final created animated graph:

### Project_02: Classification

In this project, I investigated the Titanic Dataset using Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. a comprehensive data analysis and feature engineering was performed and data was preprocessed for machine learning. Moreover, Random Forest and Logistic Regression models were trained. Accuracy scores were between 78% and 81% and a A k-fold Cross Validation scores around 96%.

### Project_03: Regression
The goal for this project was to build and train a regression model on the Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.) data set, in order to predict demand for bicycle rentals at any given hour, based on time and weather. After a detailed EDA and correlation analysis as well as feature engineeering and data preprocessing, linear regression and random forest regressor models were used to predict the number of bikes. a r2 score of 0.98 was achieved using Random Forest Regressor
