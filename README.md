### Project_01: Visual Data Analysis
The goal in this project was to visually analyze the Gapminder Dataset. This dataset includes the data for each country's population and fertiliy rate during last 200 years. Pandas and Matplotlib libraries were used to visualize the data and creating an animated scatterplot

The final created animated graph:

### Project_02: Classification

In this project, I investigated the Titanic Dataset using Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. a comprehensive data analysis and feature engineering was performed and data was preprocessed for machine learning. Moreover, Random Forest and Logistic Regression models were trained. Accuracy scores were between 78% and 81% and a A k-fold Cross Validation scores around 96%.

### Project_03: Regression
The goal for this project was to build and train a regression model on the Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.) data set, in order to predict demand for bicycle rentals at any given hour, based on time and weather. After a detailed EDA and correlation analysis as well as feature engineeering and data preprocessing, linear regression and random forest regressor models were used to predict the number of bikes. a r2 score of 0.98 was achieved for trai data using Random Forest Regressor, while the r2 score for test data was 0.87

### Project_04: Text Classification

In this project, i built a text classification model on song lyrics. The task was to predict the artist from a piece of text. python functions were programmed to do the **Web Scraping with the help of BeautifulSoup** to download song lyrics from artist's url and save only the **corpus lyrics as texts files from every single song lyrics url**. For this purpose, first, the HTML file containing the lyrics from the website was downloaded as a text file. then hyperlinks of song pages was extracted and the song lyrics were extracted using BeautifulSoup. the text were then **vectorized** using **TfidfVectorizer*** and two classification models (i.e., **logistic regression** and **random forest classifier,**) was trained to predict the artist from a piece of text. **The logistic regression showed a slightly higher score of 0.81 compared to a score of 0.79 for random forest**

### Project_05: Dashboard - Postgres, SQL, RDS, and AWS
Coming soon...

### Project_06: Pipeline - Docker, MongoDB, and ETL - Tweet sentiment analysis 
Coming soon...

### Project_07: Time Series Analysis -Forecasting the Temperature in Berlin
The objective in this project was to create a short-term temperature forecast involving time series. Main components of the time series data , i.e., Trend, seasonality and remainder (time dependance and randomness) were visualized and modeled. statistical tests are performed such as Augmented Dickey Fuller Test (ADF) and/or Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS). ARIMA model parameters like p, q, d was determined  by looking at the graphs of  auto-correlation function (ACF) and partial auto-correlation function (PACF). the prediction using linear regression model achieved a test score (r2_score) of 0.90

### Project_08: Markov simulation: simulating  customer behaviour in a supermarket
The objective of this project was to predict customer behaviour between aisles in a supermarket, applying Markov Chain modeling and Monte-Carlo simulation.
after exploratory data analysis (EDA), the transition probabilities of costunmer between the aisles were calculated. afterwards a costumer class was implemented and ran a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation for single class customer and subsequently the simulation was extended to multiple costumers.
the data used for this project is tabular data indicating where customers spent their time in different weekdays.
